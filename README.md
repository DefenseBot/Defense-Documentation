Defense Documentation
==========
The official documentation on Github, for Defense, an advanced Anti-Nuke discord bot made to defend your server against malicious users.
-------------

This documentation differs from the Gitbook version which can be found [here](https://soon.com)

The gitbook version offers:
- A general overview
- Information on setup
- Whitelisting
- Configuration

This github version will cover everything above as well as syntax/examples on each command usage, more in depth descriptions for commands, how interactions work/are used by Defense, and more. This will be upon to PR's which will let the community create/edit/delete files based on updates pushed to the bot.
